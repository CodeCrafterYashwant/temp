An intelligent, automated solution designed to modernize the way attendance is recorded and managed. This system aims to reduce manual paperwork and minimize the possibility of **proxy entries** through secure digital verification.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The application is fully deployed and operational:

* **Main Dashboard (Login):** [https://antiproxy.netlify.app](https://antiproxy.netlify.app)
* **User Registration:** [https://antiproxy.netlify.app/signup%20page/signup.html](https://antiproxy.netlify.app/signup%20page/signup.html)

> **Deployment Note:** The frontend is hosted on **Netlify** and the backend is on **Render**. Since Render's free tier spins down after inactivity, please allow **15-30 seconds** for the backend to "wake up" during the first request.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Role-based access control for Administrators, Teachers, and Students.
* **Real-time Tracking:** Instant database synchronization when attendance is marked.
* **Proxy Prevention:** Verification logic to ensure the integrity of every entry.
* **Automated Analytics:** Visualizes attendance trends with weekly and monthly percentage reports.
* **User-Friendly Dashboard:** A clean, responsive interface for managing records on any device.

## 📈 System Workflow



1.  **Login:** User authenticates via the secure portal.
2.  **Session Creation:** Teacher initiates an attendance session for a specific subject/class.
3.  **Submission:** Students mark their presence (validated via unique session tokens).
4.  **Verification:** The system checks for duplicate entries or unauthorized attempts.
5.  **Report:** Data is stored and made available for analytical reporting.
